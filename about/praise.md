title: Praise for Data Carpentry for Biologists
---

> This is one of the most immediately useful courses I've ever
> taken. Materials/resources for the class were excellent - always informative.

> LOVED THIS COURSE! I feel confident with R now and my SQL skills on are on
> fleek.

> This was a really great course, and I learned so many new skills pertaining to
> dataset management and programming. I would highly recommend this course to
> other students.

> Ethan's ability to tailor assignments specifically to help reinforce
> lecture information is excellent. The workload in the course was
> perfect - assignments were challenging and required a reasonable
> amount of time to complete, but were incredibly helpful in helping to
> understand and become familiar with the information.

> The data carpentry [course] website is by far the most succinct and integrated
> class material I've ever experienced. I wish all classes were crafted as well
> as this one.

> I thought that the course had a great combination of lecture/hands on
> learning. The assignments and exercises in class were very helpful.

> This was the first grad class I've had where I really felt like I was building
> applicable skills and wasn't being dragged through another lecture.

> I will use my final project for the entirety of my degree.

> [I] didn't know anything about programming before and I'm very happy
> with this class and amazed that I could write something that works.

> I really like the assignments. I learned so much every week by having to
> make my way through the code and felt so accomplished when it worked.

> Assignments were helpful, well written, and relevant. Lecture was
> clear and informative. The final project is a great way to let loose
> and internalize concepts.

> A great introduction to a broad and complex topic.

> After this class I feel that I really have acquired a basic understanding of
> [computing] and am ready to solve some real problems with it.

> I like the "I do- You do" approach. It helps that you do something similar but
> not exact so that we actually have to learn the program coding. I also very
> much appreciate explaining the symbols and commands in a language that we
> understand.

> i f***ing love this class and recommend it to everyone. instructor is really
> good at live coding going through lecture material and exercises.
