#### Primary Contributors

Course materials and website design have been primarily developed and
implemented by [Ethan White](http://ethanwhite.org) and [Zachary Brym](http://zackbrym.weecology.org/). See our [contributors page](https://github.com/datacarpentry/semester-biology/graphs/contributors) for more 
details.

#### Funding

The development of this course, and this site, have been supported by the Gordon
and Betty Moore Foundation's Data-Driven Discovery Initiative through grants
[GBMF4563](https://www.moore.org/grants/list/GBMF4563) and [GBMF4855](https://www.moore.org/grants/list/GBMF4855), and by an [NSF CAREER award](http://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0953694).

#### Data Carpentry

[Data Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org/) is a web and workshop based organization that is designed to teach 
basic computing concepts, skills, and tools for working with scientific data. 
The resources provided on this site are being developed in association with Data 
Carpentry.

#### Software Carpentry

[Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org) has been teaching scientists and engineers the concepts, skills, 
and tools they need to use and build software more productively since 1977. All 
of the content is freely available under a Creative Commons license (the same 
one we use here), and the existence of this content not only saves me a massive 
amount of time and effort, but also taught me a lot of what I know about 
programming well.

#### Infrastructure

The site is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) with the [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/) theme from [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) 
and icons from [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io) by Dave Gandy.
