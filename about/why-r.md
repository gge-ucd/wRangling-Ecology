title: Why R?
---

I chose to add an R version of this course for a handful of reasons
including:

1.  R is used widely in a number of disciplines, like ecology, and provides a  
    solid platform for beginner scientific programmers. Many graphing and 
    statistical operations are built right into the language.
2.  It is a broadly useful language. This means that you should be able to do 
    most anything you want to do using R, and it should be relatively easy to 
    accomplish.
3.  It's free. Funding rates for scientific research are extremely low
    at the moment and this means that expensive software licences are
    often untenable, especially for students conducting their own
    research. This also allows students in the class to program on any
    computer they want without dealing with licensing hassles, and
    guarantees that anyone can take advantage of the online resources
    that are being developed.
4.  It runs on all major operating systems.
5.  It is used by many scientific programmers and taught in many research
    science departments. This makes collaborating with experts
    on large or complex projects much easier.
6.  [Data Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org) 'lecture' materials are available
    in R, which provides a resource for students to learn more
    advanced topics on their own and allows me to avoid duplicating
    effort.  I also contribute material that I have developed back to Data 
    Carpentry.
