  <br>
  <p>There were a relatively large number of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternary_extinction_event">extinctions of mammalian
species roughly 10,000 years
ago</a>. To help
understand why these extinctions happened scientists are interested in
understanding whether there were differences in the body size of those
species that went extinct and those that did not. Since we’re starting
to get pretty good at this whole programming thing let’s stop messing
around with made up datasets and do some serious analysis.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Download the <a href="http://www.esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E084/094/MOMv3.3.txt">largest dataset on mammalian body size in the
world</a>.
Fortunately this dataset has data on the mass of recently extinct
mammals as well as extant mammals (i.e., those that are still alive
today). Take a look at the
<a href="http://www.esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E084/094/metadata.htm">metadata</a>
to understand the structure of the data. One key thing to remember
is that species can occur on more than one continent, and if they do
then they will occur more than once in this dataset. Also let’s
ignore species that went extinct in the very recent past (designated
by the word ‘historical’ in the ‘status’ column).</li>
  <li>Import the data into Python. If you’ve looked at a lot of data
you’ll realize that this dataset is tab delimited. The special
character to indicate tab in Python is “\t”</li>
  <li>To start let’s explore the data a little
    <ul>
      <li>Find out how many species are in this massive dataset and print
the result to the screen
        <ul>
          <li>If the value you see is over 5000, remember that species can
occur more than once in the dataset. You might want to look
at a function in numpy called unique.</li>
          <li>If the value you see is less than 4000, remember that
species names can be repeated in different genera, so we
actually want the unique list of latin binomials (i.e.,
genus and species combined). numpy.unique can work on a data
table with multiple columns simultaneously to accomplish
this.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Find out how many of the species are extinct and how many are
extant, print the result to the screen</li>
      <li>Find out how many genera are present in the dataset</li>
      <li>Now print the names and mass of the largest and smallest species
(note, it is not possible for a mammal to have negative mass ;)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Now let’s get to work. Calculate the average (i.e., mean) mass of an
extinct species and the average mass of an extant species and print
them to the screen. There is a numpy function (mean()) that should
help you here as well. Don’t worry about species that occur more
than once. We’ll consider the values on different continents to
represent independent data points.</li>
  <li>Print out the results in the following sentence: “The average mass
of extant species is X and the average mass of extinct species is
Y.” with the appropriate values filled in for X and Y.</li>
</ul>
