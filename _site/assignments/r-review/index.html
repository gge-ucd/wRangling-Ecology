your field crew. The data are organized in two vectors. The first vector contains the alphanumeric code for each site and the second vector contains the number
of birds banded per site. Cut and paste the vectors into your assignment and then answer the following questions by printing them to the screen.</p>

      <li><h4><a href="/wRangling-Ecology/exercises/Basic-data-management-review-R/">
        <font color="000000">-- Data Management Review --</font></a></h4>
        <p>Dr. Granger is interested in studying the relationship between the
length of house-elvesâ€™ ears and aspects of their DNA. This research is
part of a larger project attempting to understand why house-elves
possess such powerful magic. She has obtained DNA samples and ear
measurements from a small group of house-elves to conduct a preliminary
analysis (prior to submitting a grant application to the Ministry of
Magic) and she would like you to conduct the analysis for her (she might
know everything there is to know about magic, but she sure doesnâ€™t know
much about computers). She has placed the data in a file on the web for
you to <a href="/wRangling-Ecology/data/houseelf-earlength-dna-data.csv">download</a>.</p>

<p>Write an R script that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Imports the data</li>
  <li>For each row in the dataset checks to see if the ear length is <code class="highlighter-rouge">"large"</code> (&gt;10
cm) or <code class="highlighter-rouge">"small"</code> (&lt;=10 cm) and determines the GC-content of the DNA sequence
(i.e., the percentage of bases that are either G or C)</li>
  <li>Stores this information in a table where the first column has the ID for the
individual, the second column contains the string <code class="highlighter-rouge">"large"</code> or the string
<code class="highlighter-rouge">"small"</code> depending on the size of the individuals ears, and the third column
contains the GC content of the DNA sequence.</li>
  <li>Exports this table to a <code class="highlighter-rouge">csv</code> (<em>comma separated values</em>) file titled
<code class="highlighter-rouge">grangers_analysis.csv</code>.</li>
  <li>Prints the average GC-contents for large-eared elves and small-eared elves to
the screen.</li>
</ul>

<p>As you start to work on more complex problems itâ€™s important to break them down
into manageable pieces. One natural way to break this list of things down is: 1)
import data; 2) determine size category; 3) determine GC-content; 4) calculate
the size category and GC-content for each row of data and store it; 5) export
this data to <code class="highlighter-rouge">csv</code>; 6) calculate and print the average GC-content for large and
small ears.</p>

<p>Use functions to break the code up into manageable pieces. Remember to document
your code well.</p>

<p>There are several different specific approaches you could take to doing
calculations for each row of data. One is to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">dplyr</code> using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">rowwise()</code>
function
(<a href="http://www.expressivecode.org/2014/12/17/mutating-using-functions-in-dplyr/">hereâ€™s an example</a>).
Another is to loop over the rows in the data.frame using</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">for (row in 1:nrow(data)){...}</code></p>

<p>A third is to break the <code class="highlighter-rouge">data.frame</code> into vectors and use <code class="highlighter-rouge">sapply()</code>.</p>

      <li><h4><a href="/wRangling-Ecology/exercises/Making-choices-unit-conversion-challenge-R/">
        <font color="000000">-- Unit Conversion Challenge --</font></a></h4>
        <p>Measures of the amount of energy used by biological processes are critical to 
understanding many aspects of biology from cellular physiology to ecosystem 
ecology. There are many different units for energy use and their utilization 
varies across methods, research areas, and lab groups. Write a function, 
<code class="highlighter-rouge">convert_energy_units(energy_value, input_unit, output_unit)</code> to convert units 
between the following energy values - Joules(J), Kilojoules(KJ), Calories(CAL), 
and Kilocalories (KCAL; <em>this is unit used for labeling the amount of energy 
contained in food</em>). A Kilojoule is 1000 Joules, a Calorie is 4.1868 Joules, a
Kilocalorie is 4186.8 Joules. An example of a call to this function would look 
like:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>energy_in_cal &lt;- 200
energy_in_j &lt;- convert_energy_units(energy_in_cal, "CAL", "J")
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Make this function more efficient by linking <code class="highlighter-rouge">if else</code> statements. If either the 
input unit or the output unit do not match the five types given above, have the 
function print - â€œSorry, I donâ€™t know how to convert â€œ + the name of the unit 
provided. <em>Instead of writing an individual conversion between each of the 
different currencies (which would require 12 if statements) you could choose to 
convert all of the input units to a common scale and then convert from that 
common scale to the output units. This approach is especially useful since we 
might need to add new units later and this will be much easier using this 
approach.</em></p>

<p>Use your function to answer the following questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What is the daily metabolic energy used by a human (~2500 KCALs) in Joules.</li>
  <li>How many times more energy does a common seal use than a human? The common   seal uses ~52,500 KJ/day (<a href="http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.nutr.19.1.247">Nagy et al. 1999</a>). Use the daily human metabolic cost given above.</li>
  <li>How many ergs (ERG) are there in one kilocalorie. <em>Since we didnâ€™t include the erg conversion this should trigger our â€˜donâ€™t know how to convertâ€™ message</em></li>

        <font color="000000">-- Tree Biomass Challenge --</font></a></h4>
        <p>Understanding the total amount of biomass (the total mass of all individuals) in 
forests is important for understanding the global carbon budget and how the 
earth will respond to increases in carbon dioxide emissions. Measuring the mass 
of entire trees is difficult, and itâ€™s pretty much impossible to weigh an entire 
forest <em>even if we were willing to clear cut a forest for science</em>, but 
fortunately we can estimate the mass of a tree based on its diameter.</p>

<p>There are lots of equations for estimating the mass of a tree from its diameter, 
but one good option is the equation M = 0.124 * D<sup>2.53</sup>, where M is measured in 
kg of dry (above-ground) biomass and D is in cm d.b.h. (Brown 1997). Weâ€™re going 
to estimate the total tree biomass for trees in a 96 hectare area of the Western 
Ghats in India.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Write a function that takes a vector of tree diameters as an argument and <br />
returns a vector  of tree masses.</li>
  <li><a href="http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E091/216/Macroplot_data_Rev.txt">The raw data</a>
is available on <a href="http://esapubs.org/Archive/">Ecological Archives</a>, but
unfortunately due to poor database structure using all of the trees would be
a hassle. You could try to solve this problem yourself, but it turns out
that someone else has already solved it for you. Install the
<a href="http://ecodataretriever.org/">EcoData Retriever</a> and use it to download and
cleanup this data automatically (using the command line interface the
command would be <code class="highlighter-rouge">retriever install csv Ramesh2010</code> and the data will be
stored in <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ramesh2010-macroplots.csv</code>) and import it into R.</li>
  <li>If you look at the file or <a href="http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E091/216/metadata.htm">the
metadata</a>
carefully youâ€™ll notice that the data is actually in girth (i.e.,
circumference, which is equal to pi * diameter) rather than
diameter. Write a function to take an vector of circumferences as an
argument and returns an vector of diameters.</li>
  <li>Use the two functions youâ€™ve written to estimate the total biomass
(i.e., the sum of the masses) of trees in this dataset and print the
result to the screen.</li>
