      <li><h4><a href="/wRangling-Ecology/exercises/Higher-order-functions-species-area-relationship-R/">
        <font color="000000">-- Species Area Relationship --</font></a></h4>
        <p>The species-area relationship characterizes the relationship between the number 
of species observed at a site and the area being sampled. This relationship is 
used widely in ecology and conservation biology for tasks such as estimating the 
location of biodiversity hotspots to prioritize for conservation.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there is no consensus on the form of the equation that best 
describes the species-area relationship. This means that any estimate of species 
richness depends on the choice of model. Most of the models have roughly 
equivalent statistical support and we are going to be making predictions for 
regions where there is no data so we can’t determine the best model 
statistically. Instead we are going to take a consensus approach where we 
estimate the species richness using all possible models and then use the average 
prediction as our best estimate.</p>

<p>We are going to deal with five models today (which is already kind of a lot), but according to some authors there are as many as 20 reasonable models for the 
species-area relationship, so we’ll want to make our code easily extensible. The 
five models we will work with are those defined by Dengler and Oldeland (2010).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Power: S = b<sub>0</sub> * A<sup>b<sub>1</sub></sup></li>
  <li>Power-quadratic: S = 10<sup>(b<sub>0</sub> + b<sub>1</sub> * log(A) + b<sub>2</sub> * log(A)<sup>2</sup>)</sup></li>
  <li>Logarithmic: S = b<sub>0</sub> + b<sub>1</sub> * log(A)</li>
  <li>Michaelis-Menten: S = b<sub>0</sub> * A / (b<sub>1</sub> + A)</li>
  <li>Lomolino: S = b<sub>0</sub> / (1 + b<sub>1</sub><sup>log(b<sub>2</sub>/A)</sup>)</li>
</ul>

<p>All logarithms are base 10. The parameters for each model are available below, 
along with the areas at which we wish to predict species richness. Each sublist 
contains the parameters for one model in the order given above. All models 
contain b<sub>0</sub> and b<sub>1</sub>, but only the Power-quadratic and Lomolino models contain the 
third parameter b<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>sar_parameters &lt;- list(c(20.81, 0.1896), c(1.35, 0.1524, 0.0081),
c(14.36, 21.16), c(85.91, 42.57), c(1082.45, 1.59, 390000000))

areas &lt;- c(1, 5.2, 10.95, 152.3, 597.6, 820, 989.8, 1232.5, 15061)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>These can be cut and paste into your code. Alternatively, if you’re looking for
a more realistic challenge you can import the related <code class="highlighter-rouge">csv</code> files for
<a href="/wRangling-Ecology/data/sar-model-data.csv">the parameters</a> and <a href="/wRangling-Ecology/data/sar-areas.csv">the areas</a> directly from the web. 
Dealing with extracting the data you need from a standard <code class="highlighter-rouge">csv</code> import will be a 
little challenging, but you’ll learn a lot (and you can always solve the main 
problem first and then go back and solve the import step later; which might well 
be what an experienced programmer would do in this situation).</p>

<p>Write a script that calculates the richness predicted by each model for each
area, and exports the results to a <code class="highlighter-rouge">csv</code> file with the first column containing 
the area for the prediction and the second column containing the mean predicted
richness for that area. To make this easily extensible you will want to write a
function that defines each of the different species-area models (5 functions

        <p>There are many diverse sources of biological data in the modern world,
but not all of them are nicely cultivated into well structured data. For
a project you’re working on you need a list of all of the rodent species
in the world. You find a great list of rodents by following <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rodents">the first
link</a> on a Google search
for <em>List of Rodents</em>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it’s in HTML and scraping HTML is generally considered to
be a bit of a nightmare. Fortunately it’s a Wikipedia article and
Wikipedia has a nice feature to let us see the source code (or wiki
markup) that is used to build the HTML. This is same as what we would
see if we clicked on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Edit</code> tab of the article, but accessible in a
simple text file. This can be done using the general url:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=PAGETITLE&amp;action=raw</code></p>

<p>where <code class="highlighter-rouge">PAGETITLE</code> is replaced with the actual title of the page.</p>

<p>Download the wiki markup and write a short script using regular

        <p>This is a follow up to <a href="/wRangling-Ecology/exercises/Basic-data-management-review-R">Data Management Review</a>.</p>

<p>While you were out of town doing field work over the summer Dr. Granger hired
another student, Gregory Goyle, to help her modify your code so that it did
something a bit different than the original code. The new code was intended to
include more size classes and to output the average GC content for each size
class to a <code class="highlighter-rouge">csv</code> file rather than the individual level data. Unfortunately Greg
hasn’t learned an important lesson about programming, that it’s
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html">almost always better to work with existing code than to try to rewrite it from scratch</a>,
so he figured it would be easier to just start over than to try to understand
what you’d already done. Sadly Greg isn’t quite the programmer you are and so
didn’t actually finish the project before having to stop to focus on his course
work now that school is back in session (and boy does he need to focus). So,
he’s committed the current version of his code to your repository. It has all of
the parts in place, but isn’t exactly… well… working just yet.</p>

<p>You don’t want to make the same mistake that Greg did and besides, your computer
crashed over the summer and you weren’t using version control (it’s OK, it’s not 
your fault), so you’ll need to work with Greg’s code, such as it is.  Find the 
bugs in the code and fix them. You’ll need to both read the code and use a 
debugger to understand what’s going on and fix the problems. Get the code 
cleaned up at least up to the point where the code is actually executing. You’re 
welcome to find and fix/improve other issues as well, but you’ll also be writing 
tests later to help you track the tricky problems down, so the really important 
thing at this point is to get the code running so that you can actually run the 
tests.</p>

        <p>This is a follow up to <a href="/wRangling-Ecology/exercises/Debugging-debug-the-code-R">Debug the Code</a>.</p>

<p>Write tests for your ‘Debug the Code’ code for the following cases and save it in a 
file called <code class="highlighter-rouge">Tests-R.R</code>. Make corrections/improvements to the ‘Debug the Code’ code 
so that all of your tests pass.</p>

  <li>on a sequence represented by lower case string.</li>
  <li>on a sequence represented by mixed case string.</li>
  <li>on a sequence represented by multiline string.</li>
</ol>

<p>In an email accompanying your “updated” code, Dr. Granger indicated that
the specifications for the earlength size classes were:</p>

<ol>
  <li>extralarge: earlength &gt;= 15</li>
  <li>large: 10 &lt;= earlength &lt; 15</li>
  <li>medium: 8 &lt;= earlength &lt; 10</li>
  <li>small: earlength &lt; 8</li>
</ol>

  <li>for each case when the numbers are in the range,</li>
  <li>for the edgecases of 8, 10, and 15,</li>
  <li>but the function fails if non-numerical values are input as an argument
(e.g., a string from a header row that didn’t get removed).</li>
