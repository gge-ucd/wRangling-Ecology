  <blockquote>
  <p>This is one of the most immediately useful courses I’ve ever
taken. Materials/resources for the class were excellent - always informative.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>LOVED THIS COURSE! I feel confident with R now and my SQL skills on are on
fleek.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This was a really great course, and I learned so many new skills pertaining to
dataset management and programming. I would highly recommend this course to
other students.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ethan’s ability to tailor assignments specifically to help reinforce
lecture information is excellent. The workload in the course was
perfect - assignments were challenging and required a reasonable
amount of time to complete, but were incredibly helpful in helping to
understand and become familiar with the information.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The data carpentry [course] website is by far the most succinct and integrated
class material I’ve ever experienced. I wish all classes were crafted as well
as this one.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I thought that the course had a great combination of lecture/hands on
learning. The assignments and exercises in class were very helpful.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This was the first grad class I’ve had where I really felt like I was building
applicable skills and wasn’t being dragged through another lecture.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I will use my final project for the entirety of my degree.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>[I] didn’t know anything about programming before and I’m very happy
with this class and amazed that I could write something that works.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I really like the assignments. I learned so much every week by having to
make my way through the code and felt so accomplished when it worked.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Assignments were helpful, well written, and relevant. Lecture was
clear and informative. The final project is a great way to let loose
and internalize concepts.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>A great introduction to a broad and complex topic.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>After this class I feel that I really have acquired a basic understanding of
[computing] and am ready to solve some real problems with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I like the “I do- You do” approach. It helps that you do something similar but
not exact so that we actually have to learn the program coding. I also very
much appreciate explaining the symbols and commands in a language that we
understand.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>i f***ing love this class and recommend it to everyone. instructor is really
good at live coding going through lecture material and exercises.</p>
